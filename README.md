# sigrid-integrations

This repo contains useful code we've created to leverage the power of the Sigrid API. The code is provided as-is, so when you use it, sanity-check your results. We do accept pull requests, so don't hesitate to contribute. Given the as-is nature of the repo, code maybe added, changed, removed or restructured as we learn more.
